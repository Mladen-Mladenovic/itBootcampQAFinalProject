# itBootcampQAFinalProject
Final project for QA course at ITbootcamp

## General information
This project is the result of a 160 hours long QA course organised by [_IT Bootcamp_](https://itbootcamp.rs/course/testiranje-softvera-qa/).
The aim is to showcase what we learned at the course, but I made it a bit more long term with an idea to gradually expand its scope and occasionally update existing cases.

## The project is made in Java using:
  Eclipse IDE,
  TestNG with POM,
  Apache POI,
  Selenium with chromedriver,
  and is being developed on macOS and Ubuntu.
  
## Goal  
Original goal was to test the [_Practice_Form_Page_](https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form) thoroughly, and automate most of the cases using some creative solutions. 
My take on it is to expand as time goes and keep it as a long-term practice project, focusing at one page at a time.
 
All documentation can be found in itBootcampQAFinalProject/ZavrsniProjekat/Docs/ directory.
Since I'm working on different systems often compatibility.txt file is used for keeping track of environment-based variables (paths, drivers, etc).
